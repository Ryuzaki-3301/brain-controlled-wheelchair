This project is made by Ryuzaki.
This was a project orginally made for a international-level robotics contest (which shall remain un-named for my privacy since I won the competition.) 
This project is about a EEG wave controlled wheelchair.

I use the EEG waves generated when we blink. This project is still a prototype, it can definitely be made better, such as making it use the brain's EEG Waves directly. I could not do it due to my lack of knowledge in the subject itself and me being unable to acquire the required hardware for transmitting the brain EEG signals.
I am mostly not going to be working on enchaning this project, since I do not have much interest in robotics.
